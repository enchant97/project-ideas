## Intro
This will be a calculator that can take in two numbers from the user and calculate an answer with a given operation (add or subtract).


## Requirements
- Get two numbers from the user as separate variables
- *Extra*: Validate user input
- Convert numbers input into a float
- Get operator from user, for example: add or subtract
- Do “math” with selected operator
- Store result in a variable
- Output the result


## Guide
1. Create two variables that will be used to store the input numbers
   - Choose a float type if your language is statically typed
   - These two variables could be called "num_a" and "num_b"
2. Output "Enter Number A: " to console
3. Accept input from console, converting to a float and storing in the "num_a" variable
   1. *Extra*: check if input entered is a valid float, if not exit with a error message
4. Repeat 2 & 3, but store in "num_b"
5. Create a variable called "operator", this will be a string type
6. Output "Do you want to (add) or (subtract)? " to console
7. Accept input from console and store into "operator" variable
8. Create a variable called "result" that will be a float type
9.  Create a if statement that checks for the "operator" variable equalling "add"
   1.  Add variable "num_a" and "num_b" together (num_a + num_b)
   2.  Store the result in "result" variable
   3.  Output "result" variable to console
10. Create a elif/else if statement that checks for the "operator" variable equalling "subtract"
    1.  Subtract variable "num_b" from "num_a" (num_a - num_b)
    2.  Store the result in "result" variable
    3.  Output "result" variable to console
11. Create an else statement
    1.  Output "Invalid operator given"
12. Program finished


## Running
{{< project/run-intro >}}

### Example Interactions
Here is what a finished solution should look like to a user

#### Add

```
Enter Number A: 1
Enter Number b: 2
Do you want to (add) or (subtract)? add
3
```

#### Invalid

```
Enter Number A: 1
Enter Number b: 2
Do you want to (add) or (subtract)? hello
Invalid operator given!
```


## Extra
- Implement the steps indicated with "*Extra*"
- Add multiplying and dividing
- Accept more than two numbers
- Handle invalid inputs better, *add a loop and keep asking until user enters correct value*
- Make the result output more user friendly, e.g "Result num_a + num_b = result"
- Take a look at the example solutions, *you could learn how to write it in a different language*
